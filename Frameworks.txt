You can fin TestNG official documentation from below link

http://testng.org/doc/index.html

TestNg is an testing framework and it is a building block for a framework design. Especially in selenium and unit testing, it is same like 
JUNit. TestNg stands in same line of JUnit with added strong features.Now-a-days people are preferring testNG because of its easyness and 
friendlyness. 
Where we use TestNG in developing framework?
First thing is we can execute test cases in  a batch. we can trigger hundreds of test cases at a time using TestNG libraries and also in 
some cases you can run only needed few test cases at a time out of hundreds of available one. Basically you can group them and run them 
seperately in case of different regression and smoke testing.We can have and view excellent reports with the help of TestNG and also you 
date drive.In general like in traditional frameworks people use excel and lot of API'S excel API'S to get th data from Excel. But with 
the help of TestNg there is an in-built library to drive data from external source. With the help of annotations in TestNG we can design a neat and 
robust selenium test cases. It has a good integration with Maven. We can integrate TestNG with external tools as jenkins, maven.

Configure TestNG in eclipse:

testng.org/doc/download.html

Help> Install new software> it will Launch window panel> copy url from above link htt:??beust.com/eclipse and paste it in work with
space>add> give name as TestNG>OK> Tick the TestNG check box> Next(it will take time to install> Next> accept licence> it will install
software> click yes Restart eclipse

Chekcing: Windows> Preferences> you can see TestNG

Implementing TestNG:
File> New> Java Project> Give project name> Create pacakge> Give packet name> Create class> Give Class name> good to go

Class file
No need to write main function but you can run the program because of testNG library
But you should write code inside a method if not you get errors.
Run the code as Run as > TestNG Test ---> executing using TestNG Library

Advantage: We can write multiple test cases in single file
Execution of test cases is based upon the alphabetical order

Annotations: BeforeTest, AfterTest, BeforeMethod, AfterMethod, Test.
